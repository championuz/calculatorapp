# Calculator App in React Native

This is a simple calculator app built in React Native that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. The app includes buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point (.), and just two basic arithmetic operations: addition (+) and subtraction (-).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up the development environment and run the app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following software installed:

1. Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

2. Set up React Native: Set up React Native on your PC using npm (Node Package Manager). Check out [Their documentation](https://nodejs.org):

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository.

### Installing Dependencies

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd calculator-app
npm install
```

### Running the App

To run the app in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm react-native start
```

This will start the metro server, and you'll see the short symbols to run it on a simulator.

#### Running on an Emulator/Simulator

- **iOS Simulator (macOS only)**:
  - Press "i" in the terminal to open the app in the iOS simulator.

- **Android Emulator**:
  - Press "a" in the terminal to open the app in the Android emulator.

### Using the Calculator App

Once the app is running on your device or emulator, you'll see the calculator interface with buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, and arithmetic operations.

- **Performing Calculations**:
  - Tap on the digit buttons to enter numbers.
  - Use the equal (=) button to display the result of the expression.

- **Clearing the Expression**:
  - Tap on the "C" button to clear the current expression.

### Customizing the App

This calculator app is a basic template, and you can customize it to add more features or improve its design and functionality. Feel free to explore and modify the components, styles, and logic to suit your specific requirements.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and run the calculator app in React Native. Now you can use it for basic arithmetic calculations and even customize it to add more advanced functionalities. Happy coding!
